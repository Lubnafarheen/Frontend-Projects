        <h1>Photography</h1>

        <p>
          Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable
          images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image
          sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
          photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science,
          manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its
          more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational
          purposes, hobby, and mass communication.[1] Typically, a lens is used
          to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image
          on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed
          exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical
          charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in
          a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result
          with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is
          later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or
          positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the
          method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used
          to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as
          a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.

          Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries,
          relating to seeing an image and capturing the image. The discovery of
          the camera obscura ("dark chamber" in Latin) that provides an image of
          a scene dates back to ancient China. Greek mathematicians Aristotle
          and Euclid independently described a camera obscura in the 5th and 4th
          centuries BCE.[11][12] In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician
          Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his experiments.
